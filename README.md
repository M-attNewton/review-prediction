## Restuarant Review Prediction Project

# Summary
This is a personal project to predict the review ratings (1-5) of resturants given the written review and additional information about the restuarant.

This project involved:
* Data cleaning: e.g. Removing stopwords, Lemmatization, Tokenization etc.
* Feature engineering
* Establishing a baseline model
* Experimenting with different Deep Learning methods
* Creating an ensemble machine learning model

# Data Cleaning
The main dataset is a very large collection of resuarant reviews (over two million samples). Consisting of the written review, review title, date, review ID, restaurant ID and rating (target label). There is an additional dataset containing details about the restaurant, consisting ofL resturant ID, name, price interval, rating and type.
